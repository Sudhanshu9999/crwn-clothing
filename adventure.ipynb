                  Harry Potter and The Horcrux of Cambridge ⊃━☆ﾟ.*・｡ﾟ

    It is the the annual Hogwarts International Vacation!
    Students' magical powers are dampened by the potion they were made to drink 
    before they got on to the Jacobite! 
    Everything is going well until you, Harry Potter, 
    have checked into the Royal Sonesta hotel.
    This modern hotel may seem fun, futuristic, and fancy, but has a dark history behind it. 
    It is said to have been built on the rarest mixed-soil of crimson pearl-obsidian, 
    traces of which were once found in VoLdEMoRt's room at Wool's orphanage. 
    On the first night of your adventure, 
    your friend Ginny goes missing from her room!
    You hear voices in your head about it and have realized that you need to save her before the sun rises. 
    Get through the obstacles and defeat all the monsters 
    in the trenches of the hotel and save Ginny!!! 
    You have 5 hours!
    
 Are you ready to play? (y or n)
